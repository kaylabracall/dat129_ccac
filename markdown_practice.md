List items may consist of multiple paragraphs. Each subsequent paragraph in a list item must be indented by either 4 spaces or one tab:

1.  This is a list item with two paragraphs. 

    Paragraph 2 needs to have the spacing / tabs done correctly in order for it to work. First line must be indented with 4 spaces or a tab. Subsequent lines do not need to be, but it looks  better 

2.  List item 2

Paragraph text to break up list examples 

* A list item 
* A list item with a blockquote:
	> This is a blockquote
	> inside a list item. The delimiter must be indented
* To put a code block within a list item, the code block needs to be indented twice - 8 spaces or two tabs
* list item with a code block:
		<code goes here>

In order to avoid starting a numbered list when you don't want to, the number should be written with an escape character "\."

1994\. It was a great year 


To produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent every line of the block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab. For example, given this input:

This is a normal paragraph:
	This is a code block.
A code block continues until it reaches a line that is not indented (or the end of the article). Within a code block, ampersands (&) and angle brackets (< and >) are automatically converted into HTML entities.


Horizontal Rules: 
You can produce a horizontal rule tag (<hr />) by placing three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores on a line by themselves.
